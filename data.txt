Professor John Clinton is the token under consideration starts with a capital letter and the two tokens after are first_name followed by a last_name, and the same case that Professor John Clinton is not at the beginning of a sentence.

Dr. Peter is the token under consideration starts with a capital letter and the token after is a first_name, and the same case that Dr. Peter is not at the beginning of a sentence.


blah blah blah and Chairman Yinxue is the token under consideration starts with a lower_case letter.

Another case about Professor Alex's house.

Some other cases: Dr. is a title, and so is Doctor. The following words are also titles: Miss, Princess, Sir and Madam (They are not in the initial list of titles) But could appear in the sentence, such as:
Princess Wong and Miss Ying is a doctor. Ying is in the first name list, but Wong is not. But Rev. Wong should be highlighted since the title 'Rev.' is already in the title list.
