### IMPORTANT NOTE BEFORE RUN THE PROGRAM ###

Run main.jape for homework 6 (part 4) and click annotation "TitleWithWeight" to see all possible titles. 

See the comments in person_title_with_weight.jape for the definition of different weights.

To use these weights, for each token (annotation "TitleWithWeight") we can simply add them together and get a real number X. Of course we need more features to represent the title. Then we use Machine Learning (probably use lineare regression algorithm) and feed it tranning data to find a pivot number X' that could use as a decision boundry for title and non-title token.
